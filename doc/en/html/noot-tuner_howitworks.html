<H2>How it works</H2>
<P>
NOOT INSTRUMENT TUNER uses a mix of FFT and linear autocorrelation to reach one-cent precision with relatively narrow window sizes.<P>
Every time the display is updated, the following algorithm is computed on the current window:<P>
<UL>

  <LI> A FFT is used to find the frequency with the highest spectral density within the note and octave constraints (if selected)
  <LI> From that frequency, an interval of possible frequencies is taken.
  <LI> Autocorrelation is computed at the times corresponding to that frequency interval; the time lag corresponding to the highest autocorrelation is kept.
  <LI> Repeatedly, the frequency is halved (the time lag is doubled) and the time lag corresponding to the highest autocorrelation among the near values is kept.
</UL>
<P>
The main disadvantage of this approach is that it ceases to be precise in cases when the harmonics are far less than perfect.<P>
