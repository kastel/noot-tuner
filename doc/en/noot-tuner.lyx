'Detected note' box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This box is made of two parts.
 The tuning indicator will show how much the detected note is far from the
 expected note.
 Its colour varies according to whether the pitch is higher (blue) lower
 (red) or quite right (green).
 If the note is perfectly tuned, the indicator should be under the black
 line.

Octave selector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selecting the right octaves improves the precision of the detection and
 the readability of the indicator.
 When the octave is set to 
\family typewriter
Auto
\family default
, the program guesses it, sometimes leading to a note detection error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the standard used the middle C is in octave 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes the right octave is not the best choice, since in some cases (especial
ly with extreme notes) the base frequency is too soft to be detected precisely.
 If the detection is not precise enough (i.e.
 the indicator glitches or vibrates too much) you can safely select an octave
 lower or higher than the original one.
 Remember that if you set the octave in the control panel, the detected
 octave may not correspond to that of the note.

Window size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option affects the note detection algorithm.
 It represents the number of samples on which the FFT and autocorrelation
 (or continuous powr spectrum) are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimal window size depends on the refinement algorithm selected.
 Consider however that in any case a bigger window implies a more accurate
 measure, at the cost of reducing the reactivity of the program and increasing
 the CPU usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the default algorithm is set (
\emph on
Continuous power spectrum
\emph default
), the window size can be set at any value (at least 1/5 of the sample rate).
 If the alternate algorithm (
\emph on
Autocovariance
\emph default
) is selected, then when the window size is too little, the precision constraint
 might not be satisfied, and therefore no result is shown.
 The optimal window size in the latter case is between 16384 and 32768.

clock correction
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most cheap sound cards have inaccurate clocks, that lead to a bias in the
 frequencies detected and thus biased values in the 
\emph on
Offset
\emph default
 box (with biases up to a few cents).
 The clock correction factor is a number that multiplies the detected frequency,
 thus cancelling the bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can easily calibrate NOOT for your sound card by using a tuning fork
 (or an equivalent instrument).
 The clock correction factor in cents is the opposite of the 
\emph on

 value shown when the tuning fork is struck near the microphone.

\begin_layout Standard
With the default algorithm (

Continuous power spectrum
\emph default
), the best sampling rate is the lowest, provided that it's at least two
 times the maximum frequency to be measured.
 Usually 8000 or 16000 Hz will go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the autocorrelation-based algorithm, the best sampling rate is the
 highest.
 However, if the note isn't detected correctly, or if you see glitches,
 you can consider lowering it, taking into account that lower sampling rates
 cause longer reaction times.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extreme notes are those below 100 Hz and above 3000 Hz.
 These are not easily detected by the program.
 In order to make the tuner work well with these notes, you should first
 set the 
\emph on
Note 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
Octave
\emph default
 options in the main window, to prevent NOOT from detecting a wrong note.
 Then, you should raise the

 option.
 NOOT cannot always satisfy the precision constraint with extreme notes.

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
NOOT Instrument tuner 
\noun default
implements a two-step method to estimate a frequency with one-cent precition
 with relatively narrow window sizes.
 In the first step, the program computes the FFT of the input signal, and
 finds an initial range in which the frequency to be measured should be.
 Then, a refinement algorithm improves the measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first versions of NOOT, an autocovariance-based refinement algorithm
 were used.
 Now the default method computes a close approximation of the continuous
 power spectrum of the audio signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the old approach, every time the display is updated, the following
 algorithm is computed on the current window:
\end_layout

A FFT is used to find the frequency with the highest spectral density within
 the note and octave constraints (if selected) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From that frequency, an interval of possible frequencies is taken.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Autocorrelation is computed at the times corresponding to that frequency
 interval; the time lag corresponding to the highest autocorrelation is
 kept.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Repeatedly, the frequency is halved (the time lag is doubled) and the time
 lag corresponding to the highest autocorrelation among the near values
 is kept.

\begin_layout Standard
The main disadvantage of this approach is that it ceases to be precise in
 cases when the harmonics are far less than perfect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the new approach, the signal is compared with a wave having a frequency
 in the range detected in the first step through linear with a function
 similar to the linear correlation.
 Then the frequency of this wave is changed slightly at each step in order
 to find the waveform which is more similar to the signal, until the required
 precision is expected.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
 take away your freedom to share and change the works.
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
 freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
 remains free software for all its users.
 We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for
 most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way
 by its authors.
 You can apply it to your programs, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
 wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
 you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
 that you know you can do these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
 rights or asking you to surrender the rights.
 Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of
 the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
 of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
 assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
 you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
 there is no warranty for this free software.
 For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions
 be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously
 to authors of previous versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
 versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do
 so.
 This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom
 to change the software.
 The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
 individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
 Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice
 for those products.
 If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
 extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
 needed to protect the freedom of users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
 on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the
 special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
 proprietary.
 To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render
 the program non-free.

 The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
 if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
 This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
 as provided by copyright law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
 conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
 You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
 make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities
 for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
 License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
 Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively
 on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
 them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
 relationship with you.

\begin_layout Standard
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumventio

 by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work,
 and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the

You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
 who comes into possession of a copy.
 This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless
 of how they are packaged.
 This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way,
 but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
 Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
 access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual

Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
 a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source
 fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
 a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid

 or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses
 the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
 software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
 medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
 your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
 or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
 no charge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer
 to provide the Corresponding Source.
 This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
 only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
 subsection 6b.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
 or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
 in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
 You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along
 with the object code.
 If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
 Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
 that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
 directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
 Source.
 Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated
 to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requireme

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
 the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely
 because modification has been made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specificall
y for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction
 in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred
 to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the
 transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
 this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
 But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
 retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product
 (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requireme
nt to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work
 that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product
 in which it has been modified or installed.
 Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially
 and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules
 and protocols for communication across the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in

 If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove

 give appropriate copyright permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add

 If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing

 governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
 restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must

Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

\begin_layout Standard
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
 copy of the Program.
 Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
 of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not
 require acceptance.
 However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
 or modify any covered work.
 These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
 Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
 acceptance of this License to do so.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper

 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.

An 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

entity transaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially
 all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.
 If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each
 party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives
 whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
 could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of
 the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
 if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
\end_layout

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
 granted or affirmed under this License.
 For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge
 for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
 litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
 that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering
 for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

 For purposes of this definition,

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
 the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
 free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
 available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
 either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange
 to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
 work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
 License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Knowingly relying
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
 conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
 covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents
 in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
 you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
 grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
 authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of
 the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
 to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

discriminatory

 if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
 exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
 rights that are specifically granted under this License.
 You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
 with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under
 which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity
 of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
 the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed
 by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
 connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered
 work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
 was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise
) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
 from the conditions of this License.
 If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
 obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
 as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
 For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
 for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only
 way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
 entirely from conveying the Program.
